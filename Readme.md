this is deep learning project using convolutional neural network with the help tensorflow and kears library.
In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.
They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics.
They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems,[4] image classification, medical image analysis, natural language processing,
and financial time series.
in this project we predict xray image shows it is Covid, Pneumonia or not.
